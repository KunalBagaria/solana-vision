### How to build tools and generate revenue?

1. Create a new branch for the tool's development
2. Create a new page in the pages directory along with a new CSS file in the styles directory.
3. Follow the same design guidelines from [this design file](https://www.figma.com/file/c793cLhbqWrm4pa8DqkHfp/Solana-Vision?node-id=810%3A15656).
4. List the app in [this file](https://github.com/KunalBagaria/solana-vision/blob/main/components/apps.ts) for it to appear on the dashboard.
5. Add a 0.005 SOL network fee for any transaction to the Solana Vision wallet for any interaction. An additional 0.005 SOL fee per interaction may be added to your wallet as well. Any PRs not following this fee structure won't be merged.
